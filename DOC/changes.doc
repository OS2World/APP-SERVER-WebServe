    Fixed: CTRL/C sometimes did not shut down program.

    Added an option to put hostnames rather than IP
       addresses in the logs.
    Changed the watchdog operation to use fewer threads.
    Reduced the default limit on simultaneous connections.

   Fixed: if the Request-URI is an absoluteURI, then the
      Host parameter in the request must be ignored.

   If a client sends a blank line and then closes the connection,
      we ignore the blank line rather than replying "400 bad request".

   Fixed a persistent "file not found" problem.

Version 1.4         (14 Aug 2016)
   Fixed error in default MIME types: text/plain was being
      reported as text/plan.
   Added a few more entries to the default MIME type set.

      than from the INI/TNI file.
   This version is faulty and should not be used.

   Fixed: server port was not being read from INI file.

   If no filename specified in a URL, we choose one of
