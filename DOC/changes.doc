   Fixed a persistent "file not found" problem.

Version 1.4         (14 Aug 2016)
   Fixed error in default MIME types: text/plain was being
      reported as text/plan.
   Added a few more entries to the default MIME type set.

   Fixed: server port was not being read from INI file.

   If no filename specified in a URL, we choose one of
