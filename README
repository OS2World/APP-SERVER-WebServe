WHAT IS IT?

This is a lightweight web server: lightweight in the sense that it
provides the basics that any web server must have, but no complicated
options. It might not suit you if you have complicated requirements,
but it should correctly work for most basic web sites.

PREREQUISITES

Apart from the obvious network connectivity, all you need is to ensure
that your system has its time zone correctly set. (Faulty clock settings
make it harder for web clients or caches to know whether they have the
current version of a file.) One way to do this is to get and install
the program TZSet from the same place where you got this software.

You must of course ensure that you own one or more domain names.
(These can be purchased from a domain name registrar. Shop around, because
prices vary enormously.) You also need to ensure that a nameserver
somewhere is mapping these domain names into your IP address.

INSTALLATION

Create a suitable directory, e.g. D:\Servers\WebServe.  Unzip the zip
file into that directory.  (If you are upgrading from an earlier
version, unzip into the same directory as you used for that
earlier version, so that you can continue to use your existing
configuration data.)  Now you are ready to go.

The program Setup.exe must be run to configure the server. Most
settings can be left at their default values, but it is essential
to specify your domains in the Domains page of the Setup notebook.

RUNNING THE PROGRAM

The program WebServe.exe is the actual server. Leave this running
all of the time. (But you will need to restart it any time you change
the Setup options. The present version does not automatically
refresh the settins. Maybe in a later version.)

There are no logging options in this version. You get a detailed
transaction log both on the screen and in a file TRANSLOG.TXT.
This will probably be improved in a later version.
