WHAT IS IT?

This is a lightweight web server: lightweight in the sense that it
provides the basics that any web server must have, but no complicated
options. It might not suit you if you have complicated requirements,
but it should correctly work for most basic web sites.

If there's a missing feature that is important to you, let me know.
I can add features provided that they don't damage the "lightweight"
goal.

INSTALLATION AND OPERATION

Read the manual, webserve.INF, for all the details.
