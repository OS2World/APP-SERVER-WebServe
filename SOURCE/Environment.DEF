    (* An environment specification uses a "string of strings" format,  *)
    (* where each string is of the form "parameter=value" with a Nul    *)
    (* terminator.  The final Nul-terminated string must be followed    *)
    (* by another Nul.  This gives us a long string that may contain    *)
    (* internal Nul characters, so we cannot rely on the usual string   *)
    (* functions to work.  In particular, we must keep track of the     *)
    (* total length, because scanning for a Nul won't work.  (Scanning  *)
    (* for a double Nul would work but would be inefficient.)  The      *)
    (* convention I use here is that the length value includes all the  *)
